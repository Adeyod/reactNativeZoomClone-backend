## Amazon Clone Backend

This is the backend folder of the Zoom Clone.
I created the clone using react native for the frontend and nodejs and express for the backend. I used mongoDB for the database.
Nodejs is the runtime used and expressjs is the framework used. This provides the server-side functionality for managing the Amazon clone.

# Features

1. This only has an index file that contains the code that connect the socket.io with the frontend.
